Program to simulate Drum-Buffer-Rope effect for a custom production proces.

Export is made in 2 files, one is a table and second one is for import in Excel or similar software.

"ClanekBufferOT_NO.txt" is the original file, other are buffer examples that I used.
The names of the files with buffer are "ClanekBufferOT_xxxx_yyyy.txt", where xxxx is the number of 
first buffer and yyyy is the number of second buffer.

"ClanekCSV.txt" is file that can be importet in Excel for buffers 3000 and 4000
"ClanekCSV_NO.txt" is file for import in Excel with no buffers.
